        "Answer": "**Touch, keyboard, pen, and mouse**\n\nWith Surface, you can easily switch between using touch, a keyboard, a mouse, or a pen. \n\n*   \n\nTouch. You can use your fingers on the touchscreen, the same as you would on a smartphone. For example, drag your finger across the screen to scroll. For demos of the gestures you can use, see The Surface touchscreen on Surface.com. You can also type on the touchscreen—see How to use the Surface touch keyboard on Surface.com. \n\n*   \n\nType Cover keyboard and touchpad. The Type Cover for Surface Pro 4 (sold separately) clicks into place when you want to type and folds back out of the way when you want to use your Surface as a tablet. Because the Cover is perfectly sized for your Surface Pro 4, closing it puts your Surface to sleep while it protects the touchscreen. The Type Cover includes a touchpad \n\nthat supports Windows 10 gestures. For more info, see Touchpad use and settings on Surface.com. \n\n*   \n\nSurface Pen. Take notes, draw, and mark up documents using the Surface Pen that comes with your Surface Pro 4. Click the top button once to jot a quick note in OneNote, double-click to take a screen capture straight to OneNote, or hold the button down for a second or two to open Cortana. Write, draw, and tap naturally with the tip—while the tip is near the screen, Surface ignores touches from your hand. Flip the pen around to erase with the top button. A button near the tip lets you right-click without changing your grip. For more info, see Using Surface Pen (Surface Pro 4 version) on Surface.com. \n\n*   \n\nUSB or Bluetooth® keyboard and mouse. See Connect a USB mouse, printer, and more and Add a Bluetooth device on Surface.com to learn more. ",
